Where will you find the flag?

SOLUTION:
This programs prints stuff encoded in Bas64.
Just extract the user-written strings with
  # rabin2 -z ./cheesy
and find the string that is **not** printed on stdout by ./cheesy.
    Z2lnZW17M2E1eV9SM3YzcjUxTjYhfQ

Decode that with online tools and you'll get the flag
    gigem{3a5y_R3v3r51N6!}
