The website contains a login page, and you can try and get access this way but the username field is escaped before any sql request. However, you'll soon notice a "forgot your password?" link at the bottom of the page, which takes you to another field.

You're in luck, this one seems vulnerable. So now, you need to gain access, and to do so you need a username and a password. Trying an input of the sort "x' UNION SELECT username FROM users -- a" will display the usernames, the last row returned being "c.hackle". So now we have our username!

For the password, you can try and poke around up until you find the name of the table, or try to display the tables somehow. After a bit of poking you'll find pass_salt and pass_md5, so you now have the hash and salt of the password of c.hackle, and you know that the hash algorithm used is the (weak) md5.

Last step, you need to bruteforce the password using something like Kraken (the salt is short and the password also, so it shouldn't take too long). Finally you'll be able to login and find the flag!
