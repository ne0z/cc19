There's a secret passcode hidden in the robot's "history of cryptography" module. But it's encrypted! Here it is, hex-encoded: encrypted.txt. Can you find the hidden passcode?

Hint:
Like the title suggests, this is repeating-key XOR. You should try to find the length of the key - it's probably around 10 bytes long, maybe a little less or a little more.
