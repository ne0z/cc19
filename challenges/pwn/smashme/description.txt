In the original challenge, you are given the binary. The binary is the original one from the competition.

The goal is to write a repeatable exploit script to steal the flag (located at /challenge/flag, although it should just be flag in the current directory) remotely.

To run the challenge locally:
./docker-run.sh

Then:
nc localhost 31337
